# Work-Day-Planner

## Description

I built this project to help solve a daily problem most people face with keeping a daily schedule organized. In doing so I was 
able to apply new skill sets I've learned as well. This is what motivated me in creating this web application, to see it come to life and be benitficial to everyone. Most people try to keep in their heads of waht should be done today and try not to forget in what time order they want to do things. Instead I have built this web applicatin to save each personal task one would like to do based on the time throughout the day. I had to apply new skill sets to get this web application operating the way it should. In order to run the applicaton based on date and time I had to use Day.js libaray to collect the exact date and time. The time was used to have an organized color coded time block to indicate past, present, and future time. I also had to learn how to use Localstorage in order to save the description input based on each time block. With this coding I set variables for the time id block and also for the user description based on that time id block. When the page is refreshed all the data inputed shoudl be the same so I had to code inorder to get the data from Localstorage. As this was getting the item of time block id and assigning to the corresponding value which was the description inputed before. I was able to apply all these skills sets to get this web application running. It was a great experience to learn how to properly use them and allow the user to properly interact with the web applocation.

## Usage

To use this web application as a work day planner, you must select the hour in which you would like to address in your scheudle to set a task. You can input a description of what event or task  will happen at the given time and next you can save it with the save icon button. If the page was to refresh, your data description would not be lost and still show up on your daily schedule. Based one current time the time blocks will appear color coded for past, present, and future time.
